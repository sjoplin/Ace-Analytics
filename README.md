# Moneyball

----
### Who are we

We are students at Georgia Tech who are attempting to tackle GT softball's enemy scouting problem. They currently spend 6+ hours scouting each future opponent.

----
### What we do

We use [NCAA Stats](http://stats.ncaa.org/) to compile a list of a team's players as well as where they hit the ball in regards to the field. By doing this, we are able to plot these points on a baseball diamond as well as describe how the ball arrived there.

----
### Impact

By plotting how and where each hit goes for the players, it enables coaches to make on the spot decisions about where to defensively move each of their players to give them the best chance of success.

### Installation

This requires Python3 as well as the packages PyQt5, PIL, reportLab, bs4, and pandas. Once you have these packages, simply run \_\_init\_\_.py and input the team name as shown on the website as well as the URL of the main team page.
