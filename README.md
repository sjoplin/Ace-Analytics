# Moneyball

----
### Who are we

We are students at Georgia Tech who are attempting to tackle GT softball's enemy scouting problem. They currently spend 6+ hours scouting each future opponent.

----
### What we do

We use [NCAA Stats](http://stats.ncaa.org/) to compile a list of a team's players as well as where they hit the ball in regards to the field. By doing this, we are able to plot these points on a baseball diamond as well as describe how the ball arrived there.

----
### Impact

By plotting how and where each hit goes for the players, it enables coaches to make on the spot decisions about where to defensively move each of their players to give them the best chance of success.

----
### Installation

This only works with python3. If you plan on contributing, please create a virtual environment into a folder named "env". Once that is done, simply run \_\_init\_\_.py and input the team name as found on the team website as well as their home url.
